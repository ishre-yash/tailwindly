            (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an

            (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your

            than consent; <br />
            (iii) you have the right to learn if information is being processed

            your information is processed by automated means and that the
            processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are
            part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.

            should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing
            purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without
            providing any justification. To learn whether we are processing
